# RM_CV_101

This repo contains exercises/tutorials that serve to get
newcomers in (an arbitrary) RoboMaster Computer Vision team
to be familiar with basic concepts in RMCV. Also, it provides
a basic training of methodology for generic CV problems.

Most of the exercises are problem-based in order to facilitate
learning experiences.

This repo is maintained by [Illini RoboMaster](https://github.com/illini-robomaster)
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Please see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for tutorial on installing Python 3 and jupyter notebook.

## Intro to Python

This is a crash introductory Python course for people who
have experience with other programming languages but not
Python.
That is, readers should already be familiar
with these concepts:

- Integers
- Array (e.g. array in C)
- Functions
- Class
- Third-party libs (import/include)

After finishing this section, you should be able to
transfer your knowledge in other programming language to
Python and start working in Python immediately.

## Intro to C/C++

## Intro to OpenCV

A crash course for people with zero or little experience in
computer vision/image processing. Note that it mainly focuses
on traditional CV algorithms such as

- Image Representation
- Binirization
- Edge Detection
- Morphological Operations

other than DL algorithms. The concepts covered in it should
be sufficient for the RoboMaster competition.
